Because we used Line Buffering, outputs will be different.
In the first case we brunch line buffer with 'Hello' and then it copies to the child process and prints with '\n' two times, because line buffer prints when it meet '\n,
In second case the buffer is immediately printed before we branch process and printf prints line buffer before creating child process, so print one times Hello and two times '\n'
